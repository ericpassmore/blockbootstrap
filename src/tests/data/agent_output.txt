- **S&P 500 Index** (large-cap US stocks)
- **US Small Cap Stocks**
- **10-Year Treasuries**
- **3-Month Treasury Bills**
- **BAA Corporate Bond**
- **Real Estate**
- **Gold**
- **Bitcoin**

### **Three-Asset Diversified Portfolio**

To achieve diversification, you should select assets that:

- Have historically low to moderate correlations with one another (reduce risk/cyclical swings).
- Represent different sources of return (e.g., stocks, bonds, real assets).

#### **Recommended Asset Types**
1. **Equities (Growth)**
   - **S&P 500 Index** or **US Small Cap Stocks**
   - (Contributes growth; you could use either or a blend.)

2. **Bonds (Stability/Income)**
   - **10-Year Treasuries** or **BAA Corporate Bond**
   - (Adds stability, income, and historically negative/low correlation with stocks.)

3. **Real Assets or Alternative Assets (Inflation Hedge/Diversifier)**
   - **Real Estate**, **Gold**, or **Bitcoin**
   - (Adds real asset exposure and/or inflation protection.)

#### **Sample Diversified Trio**

- **S&P 500 Index**
- **10-Year Treasuries**
- **Gold**

**Why these three?**
- S&P 500: Stock exposure (growth engine)
- Treasuries: Bond exposure (risk reduction/income)
- Gold: Inflation hedge, non-correlated with stocks and bonds

You could also use:
- **US Small Cap Stocks** instead of S&P 500 for more "risk/growth"
- **BAA Corporate Bond** for higher yield but more risk
- **Real Estate** as the alternative asset (instead of gold)
- **Bitcoin** if you have high risk tolerance and want exposure to a very different asset class

---

**In summary:**  
A classic diversified 3-asset portfolio from your list would include:
- One equity (S&P 500 or US Small Cap)
- One bond (10-Year Treasuries or BAA Corporate)
- One real/alt asset (Gold, Real Estate, or Bitcoin)
